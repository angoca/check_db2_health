This plugin is used to monitor a variety of db2 database metrics. 

* For instructions on installing this plugin for use with Nagios,
  see below. In addition, generic instructions for the GNU toolchain
  can be found in the INSTALL file.

* For major changes between releases, read the CHANGES file.

* For information on detailed changes that have been made,
  read the Changelog file.

* This plugin is self documenting.  All plugins that comply with
  the basic guidelines for development will provide detailed help when

How to "compile" the check_db2_health script.
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile, etc.

	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-nagios-user=SOMEUSER --with-nagios-group=SOMEGROUP --with-perl=PATH_TO_PERL --with-statefiles-dir=STATE_PATH

   a) Replace BASEDIRECTORY with the path of the directory under which Nagios
      is installed (default is '/usr/local/nagios')
   b) Replace SOMEUSER with the name of a user on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   c) Replace SOMEGRP with the name of a group on your system that will be
      assigned permissions to the installed plugins (default is 'nagios')
   d) Replace PATH_TO_PERL with the path where a perl binary can be found.
      Besides the system wide perl you might have installed a private perl
      just for the nagios plugins (default is the perl in your path).
   e) Replace STATE_PATH with the directory where you want the script to
      write state files which transport information from one run to the next.
      (default is /tmp)

   Simply running ./configure will be sufficient to create a check_db2_health
   script which you can customize later.
      

2) "Compile" the plugin with the following command:

	make

    This will produce a "check_db2_health" script. You will also find
    a "check_db2_health.pl" which you better ignore. It is the base for
    the compilation filled with placeholders. These will be replaced during
    the make process.


3) Install the compiled plugin script with the following command:

	make install

   The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugin in a 
   'libexec/' subdirectory in the base directory you specified with
   the --prefix argument to the configure script.


4) Verify that your configuration files for Nagios contains
   the correct paths to the new plugin.


Command line parameters
-----------------------

--connect=<the db2 connect string>
   This is what you would also use with tnsping and sqlplus.

--user=<username>
   This is the user which reads the system tables.

--password=<secret>
   This is the user's password.

--mode=<operation mode>
   This parameter tells the plugin what it should check.
   The list of known modes may grow frequently. Please look at 
   http://www.consol.com/opensource/nagios/check-db2-health for a list
   of features.

--tablespace=<tablespace name>
  Tablespace-related modes check all tablespaces in one run by default.
  If only a single tablespace should be checked, use this parameter.

--warning=<warning threshold>
  If the metric is out of this range, the plugin returns a warning.

--critical=<critical threshold>
  If the metric is out of this range, the plugin returns a critical.

   

How to prepare the database for monitoring
--------------------------------------

Database user:
[root@dbsrv12 ~]# groupadd nagios
[root@dbsrv12 ~]# useradd -g nagios -s /bin/false nagios 
[root@dbsrv12 ~]# passwd nagios

Grant sysmon authority:
db2inst1$ db2 update dbm cfg using sysmon_group nagios
db2inst1$ db2 grant select,update on table SYSTOOLS.STMG_DBSIZE_INFO to nagios

Switch on the performance counters:
db2 update dbm cfg using dft_mon_bufpool   on
db2 update dbm cfg using dft_mon_lock      on
db2 update dbm cfg using dft_mon_timestamp on
